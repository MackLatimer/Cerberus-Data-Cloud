# Autonomous Refactoring Progress Summary

This document summarizes the work completed during the autonomous refactoring session and outlines the remaining tasks that were blocked by environment instability.

## Completed Tasks

The following major refactoring tasks have been successfully completed.

### Part 1: Backend Refactoring (`cerberus_universal_backend`)

-   **Dependencies Upgraded:** Updated `gunicorn` and `flask-cors` in `requirements.txt` to patch security vulnerabilities.
-   **Configuration Externalized:** Removed all hardcoded secrets (`SECRET_KEY`, `PGCRYPTO_SECRET_KEY`, `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI`) from the application configuration. The app now strictly loads these from environment variables.
-   **Security Utilities Centralized:** Created a new `app/utils/security.py` module and consolidated all encryption/decryption functions into it, removing duplicated code.
-   **JWT Authentication Implemented:**
    -   Built a complete JWT-based authentication system with `/register` and `/login` endpoints.
    -   Secured the sensitive voters API (`/api/v1/voters`) with a `@token_required` decorator.
-   **Critical Bug Fixes Applied:** Systematically addressed all "Critical" and "High" severity bugs from `PROBLEMS.csv`, including:
    -   Data encryption bypasses in the voters and donate routes.
    -   An SQL injection vulnerability in the agendas route.
    -   Insecure webhooks, which are now protected with signature verification.
-   **Code Cleanup:** Refactored the `get_municipalities` function to fetch data dynamically from the database.

### Part 2: Frontend Refactoring (`emmons_frontend`)

-   **Configuration Model Created:** Replaced the old JSON-based configuration with a new, pure-Dart, type-safe configuration model.
-   **Hostname-Based Loading:** The application now detects the browser's hostname at runtime and dynamically loads the correct campaign configuration (`emmons` or `blair`).
-   **UI Widgets Refactored:** All major pages and shared widgets have been refactored to be data-driven by the loaded `CampaignConfig`. This includes:
    -   `HomePage`
    -   `IssuesPage`
    -   `AboutPage`
    -   `EndorsementsPage`
    -   `DonatePage`
    -   `CommonAppBar`
    -   `Footer`
    -   `SignupFormWidget`
    -   `DonateSection`
    -   `DonationWidget` (Stripe integration)

### Part 3: Deployment Artifacts (Partial)

-   **`.dockerignore`:** Created and configured a root-level `.dockerignore` file.
-   **Backend `Dockerfile`:** Replaced the existing Dockerfile with the new, production-ready, multi-stage version from the `GCP_PLAN.md`.
-   **Frontend `Dockerfile`:** Created a new, production-ready, multi-stage Dockerfile for the Flutter web app.
-   **`nginx.conf`:** Verified and used the existing Nginx configuration for serving the frontend.
-   **`cloudbuild.yaml`:** Created a new `cloudbuild.yaml` with steps for testing, building, and deploying both the backend and frontend services.

## Remaining Tasks (Blocked by Environment)

The following tasks from the original plan could not be completed due to persistent environment failures (Docker permissions, file system errors, and lack of temporary storage space).

1.  **Run Tests:**
    -   **Backend:** I was unable to get a successful run of the backend integration tests due to the environment errors. The tests need to be run to verify the correctness of the extensive backend changes.
    -   **Frontend:** I was unable to run the frontend tests (`flutter test`).
2.  **Finalize `cloudbuild.yaml`:** The created `cloudbuild.yaml` is complete based on the plan, but it has not been tested and may require adjustments.
3.  **Delete `cerberus_campaigns_backend`:** This has been completed.
4.  **Create Manual Rename Instructions:** The plan was to create a `MANUAL_RENAME_INSTRUCTIONS.md` file after all other work was complete. This includes instructions on how to rename the `emmons_frontend` directory.

Once the environment is stable, these remaining steps should be executed to fully complete the refactoring project.
