# Refactoring Cleanup Report

*Report Generated On: 2025-08-12*

This report identifies files and directories that appear to be extraneous to the defined three-part architecture of the Cerberus-Data-Cloud project. They are candidates for deletion after careful manual review.

---

### Category 1: Files Outside Core Architecture

*These files and directories are not part of `cerberus_frontend`, `cerberus_universal_backend`, or `universal_campaign_frontend`.*

* `/ANALYSIS_SUMMARY.md`
* `/ANALYSIS.md`
* `/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`
* `/GCP_PLAN.md`
* `/get_timestamp.py`
* `/new_schema_fixed.sql`
* `/new_schema.sql`
* `/PROBLEMS.csv`
* `/PROGRESS_SUMMARY.md`
* `/PROGRESS_TRACKER.md`
* `/unused_files_report.md`
* `/app/`
* `/cerberus_campaigns_backend/`
* `/emmons_frontend/`
* `/tests/`

### Category 2: Files with Misplaced Logic

*These files are within the correct directories but contain code that violates the architectural blueprint.*

*No files were identified in this category during the initial scan. A deeper code-level analysis is required to find misplaced logic.*

---

### Category 3: Suspected Obsolete/Redundant Files

*These files are likely remnants from previous versions or tests and are no longer in use.*

* **File:** `/cerberus_universal_backend/database_schema.sql.bak`
    * **Reason:** SQL backup file, likely obsolete.
* **File:** `/cerberus_universal_backend/test.db`
    * **Reason:** SQLite database file. The project is specified to use PostgreSQL, making this a likely remnant of old tests.
* **File:** `/cerberus_universal_backend/drop_current_schema.sql`
    * **Reason:** Appears to be a one-off utility script. It may be obsolete or still needed for development setups.
* **File:** `/README.md`
    * **Reason:** The root README may contain outdated information not aligned with the new architecture.

---

### Category 4: Requires Manual Review

*Could not definitively classify these files. Manual inspection is required.*
