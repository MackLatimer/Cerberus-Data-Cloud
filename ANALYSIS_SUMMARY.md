# Analysis Summary

## Project Structure

### High-Level Overview
The Cerberus-Data-Cloud repository contains a multi-component system designed for political campaign management and public data reporting. It consists of three backend services, two frontend applications, and the necessary infrastructure and database schema definitions. The entire system is designed to be deployed on Google Cloud Platform.

### Components
*   **`cerberus_universal_backend`**: A Python Flask backend that serves as the central API for managing campaign data, including voters, interactions, donations, and user authentication.
*   **`cerberus_campaigns_backend`**: This appears to be a duplicate or legacy version of `cerberus_universal_backend`. The project's main documentation and build scripts primarily reference `cerberus_universal_backend`.
*   **`cerberus_report_backend`**: A Python Flask backend for scraping, storing, and serving public municipal agenda data. It also manages user subscriptions for agenda notifications.
*   **`cerberus_frontend`**: A Flutter web application that acts as a multi-purpose data portal. It provides an interface for uploading and managing campaign data (connecting to `cerberus_universal_backend`) and a "Cerberus Report" page for viewing public agenda data (connecting to `cerberus_report_backend`).
*   **`emmons_frontend`**: A Flutter web application that serves as a public-facing website for a specific political campaign (the "Emmons" campaign). It connects to `cerberus_universal_backend` for functionalities like mailing list signups and donations.
*   **`universal_campaign_frontend`**: This directory contains a template or base for a universal campaign frontend, but it is not fully integrated or documented in the main project.

### Technologies
*   **Backend**: Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL
*   **Frontend**: Flutter
*   **Database**: PostgreSQL
*   **Deployment**: Docker, Google Cloud Build, Google Cloud Run
*   **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform (in `cerberus_full_stack_infrastructure`)

### Interactions
*   `emmons_frontend` and `cerberus_frontend` communicate with `cerberus_universal_backend` via a REST API to manage campaign-related data.
*   `cerberus_frontend`'s "Cerberus Report" feature communicates with `cerberus_report_backend` to fetch and display public agenda items.
*   The backends use a shared PostgreSQL database, with schemas defined in the `sql_schemas` directory and managed via Flask-Migrate.
*   The `cloudbuild.yaml` file orchestrates the continuous integration and deployment pipeline, building Docker images for each service and deploying them to Google Cloud Run.

## Identified Issues
*   **Redundant Backend**: The presence of both `cerberus_universal_backend` and `cerberus_campaigns_backend` suggests a need for code cleanup and consolidation.
*   **Missing `cerberus_report_backend`**: The directory for this backend is missing, despite being referenced in the documentation and `cerberus_frontend`.
*   **Incomplete `universal_campaign_frontend`**: This component appears to be a work in progress and is not fully integrated.

## Proposed Fixes
*   No fixes are proposed at this time, as the immediate task is analysis and documentation. A follow-up task could be created to address the identified issues.
